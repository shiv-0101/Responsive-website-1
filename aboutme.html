          <h2>My name is Shiv and living the amazing life.</h2>
          <p class="aboutme-para">
            <strong> I used to be a pack rat.</strong> I had so many things that
            I thought that I loved, but the truth was I couldn't even appreciate
            any of it because there was too much. <br /><br />
            Things were terrible. I had a job that I hated, a home that I didn't
            want to live in, and I couldn't hold a relationship.
          </p>
          <h3>How I turned things around</h3>
          <p class="aboutme-para">
            <strong>
              I was on the verge of a breakdown when I got rid of
              everything.</strong
            >
            I literally put 90% of my possessions in the garbage, sold my place
            and moved into a smaller apartment, and I quit my job. <br /><br />
            It wasn't easy at all, but everything around me was in such a bad
            place, I didn't know what else to do. And it worked.
          </p>
          <h3>Now I live amazing life</h3>
          <p class="aboutme-para">
            Now that I'm living a simple life, things are so much better. I'm
            less stressed, enjoy life and work more, and I have more free time
            to enjoy. <br /><br />
            With how much it turned my life around,
            <strong
              >I felt like I had no choice but to start sharing how I did
              it</strong
            >, and how others can benefit from living a simple life as well,
            which is why I started this site!
